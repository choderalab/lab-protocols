#Transformation Protocol Using BL21- Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL Competent Cells
#### Protocol from https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/230240.pdf

##Materials
- Plasmids
- LB agar plates that contain the appropriate antibiotic
- Cells BL21 DE3
- SOC Media 

##Procedure

- Thaw the competent cells on ice.
- Add 2.0 μl of the 1:10 dilution of β-mercaptoethanol to each of the 100-μl aliquots of competent cells. 
- Swirl the contents of the tubes gently. Incubate the cells on ice for 10 minutes, swirling gently every 2 minutes.
- Add 1–50 ng of expression plasmid DNA containing the gene of interest to each tube of cells and swirl gently. Use 10 ng of each plasmid for co-transformation.  
- Incubate the reactions on ice for 30 minutes.
- Preheat SOC medium (see Preparation of Media and Reagents) in a 42°C water bath for use in step 11.
- Heat-pulse each transformation reaction in a 42°C water bath for 20 seconds. The duration of the heat pulse is critical for optimal transformation efficiencies (see Length of the Heat Pulse).
- Incubate the reactions on ice for 2 minutes.
- Add 0.9 ml of preheated (42°C) SOC medium to each transformation reaction and incubate the reactions at 37°C for 1 hour with shaking at 225–250 rpm. 
- Using a sterile spreader, spread ≤ 200 μl of the cells transformed with the experimental DNA onto LB agar plates that contain the appropriate antibiotic.
- Transformants will appear as colonies following overnight incubation at 37°C.
