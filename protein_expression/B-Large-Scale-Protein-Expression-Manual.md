MANUAL PROTOCOL B

B. **Large Scale Protein Expression**

Adapted from:
Seeliger lab Src Expression Protocol

SUMMARY:

With this large scale protein expression protocol start with transformed cells and end with 1L worth of pellet of cells with your protein of choice ready for storage in the -80ºC freezer or lysis.

TIMING: 1 DAY (24 HOURS)

MATERIALS:

- Plate or glycerol stock with plasmid with gene of choice in cells of choice
- 1-2L of Media (2xYT or 2xYT AutoInduction (AIM) media)
- Antibiotic
- If not AIM media also need:
  - Cuvette
  - Fresh 1M IPTG
- Centrifuge bottles for spinning down cells.
- Conical tubes for storing resuspended cells.

BUFFERS:

**Nickel Buffer A**
25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM Na Cl, 5% Glycerol, 20 mM Imidazole

EQUIPMENT: Incubator and Centrifuge.

Ideally this protocol is preceded by Manual Protocol A: Transformation (OVERNIGHT).

PROTOCOL:

1.	Inoculate 1L of media (with appropriate antibiotic) with a swab from a plate of freshly transformed colonies (from protocol A) or a glycerol stock. **Incubate at 37ºC with shaking until reaches an OD600 of 0.4** (record how much time this takes, check every hour, guessing this will take ~3 hrs). Once the culture reachs OD600 of 0.4 turn the incubator temperature down to **18ºC for 1 hr**.
2.	If not using 2xYT AIM media, after this hour at the lower temperature, induce cells with 200 uL new 1M IPTG. Let grow overnight **(18 hours)**.
3.	Measure OD600 of cells before harvesting. To harvest, spin down cells at 6000 xg (RCF) for 15 minutes at 4ºC in the H6000A rotor that fits the 1L bottles on the 11th Floor. Weigh cells by weighing empty centrifuge bottles before filling and after decanting supernatant.
4.	Resuspend cells in 80 mL’s per initial liter of culture in **Nickel Buffer A**.
5.	At this point cells can be frozen at -80ºC, or you can continue on to Protocol C: Large Scale Protein Purification (2 DAYS). If opting to freeze the cells for future lysis, aliquot into 50 mL conical tubes ensuring not to overfill (they will expand). It is likely this will be more than one tube, if so label individual tubes appropriately, for example 1/2 and 2/2 if there are two tubes.

- Markus Seeliger's tech notes that she starts cultures with '100 ul' of cells from a plate, but so far our transformations were not able to yield that many colonies. So far we have started from 1 colony each time. The first time, nothing grew for 7 hours, so we left the cultures overnight after which both 2xYT and AIM media resulted in ~ 12 g cells and and OD600 of 3.5 . The second time, we decided to inoculate in the morning with a small-scale culture that had been growing overnight (6mL 2xYT with 6uL Kan and Spec, innoculated with 1 colony and left at 37ºC overnight). By morning this overnight culture was at OD 600 of 1.25, and 1 L of media was innoculated with 2 mL of this (a glycerol stock was also made of this overnight).

- **Hours to OD600 of 0.4** When innoculating with overnight culture at 11:30 AM the OD 600 increased as follows (3hrs 45 mins til OD600 of 0.4):

  - 12:30 pm: 2xYT= 0.0101, AIM= 0.0395

  - 1:30 pm: 2xYT= 0.0400, AIM= 0.0669

  - 3:00 pm: 2xYT= 0.2618, AIM= 0.2560

  - 3:30 pm: 2xYT= 0.5870, AIM= 0.4929

- **OD600 at Harvest** When cells were incubated for ~18 hours after IPTG induction of 2xYT (for AIM media this was 4 hours at 37ºC and 18 hours at 18ºC), the OD 600 was 3.5 for the 2xYT and 3.7 for the AIM. Cell pellets were 16.7 g for the 2xYT and 20.2 g for the AIM.
