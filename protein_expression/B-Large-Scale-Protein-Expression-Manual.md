MANUAL PROTOCOL B

B. **Large Scale Protein Expression**

Adapted from:
Seeliger lab Src Expression Protocol

SUMMARY:

With this large scale protein expression protocol start with transformed cells and end with 1L worth of pellet of cells with your protein of choice ready for storage in the -80ºC freezer or lysis.

TIMING: 1 DAY (24 HOURS)

MATERIALS:

- Plate or glycerol stock with plasmid with gene of choice in cells of choice
- 1-2L of Media (2xYT or 2xYT AutoInduction (AIM) media)
- If not AIM media also need:
  - Cuvette
  - Fresh 1M IPTG
- Centrifuge bottles for spinning down cells.
- Conical tubes for storing resuspended cells.

BUFFERS:

**Nickel Buffer A**
25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM Na Cl, 5% Glycerol, 20 mM Imidazole

EQUIPMENT: Incubator and Centrifuge.

Ideally this protocol is preceded by Manual Protocol A: Transformation (OVERNIGHT).

PROTOCOL:

1.	Inoculate 1L of media with a swab from a colony on a plate or a glycerol stock. **Incubate at 37ºC with shaking until reaches an OD600 of 0.4** (record how much time this takes, check every hour, guessing this will take ~3 hrs). Turn temperature down to **18ºC for 1 hr**.
2.	If not using 2xYT AIM media, induce cells with 200 uL new 1M IPTG. Let grow overnight **(18 hours)**.
3.	Measure OD600 of cells before harvesting. To harvest, spin down cells at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes.
4.	Resuspend cells in 175 mL’s per initial Liter culture of **Nickel Buffer A**.
5.	At this point cells can be frozen at -80ºC, or you can continue on to Protocol C: Large Scale Protein Purification (2 DAYS).

NOTES:

- Note which centrifuge, centrifuge bottles, and rotor that must be used.
- Hours to OD600 = 0.4: 
- OD600 at Harvest: 
- Comparing 2xYT and 2xYT AIM
- Is 1L enough? Should we always use 2L?
