MANUAL PROTOCOL A

A. **Transformation into Rosetta DE3 pLysS cells**

SUMMARY:

With this transformation protocol introduce your plasmid of choice into Rosetta DE3 pLysS cells for protein expression. Co-transformation instructions included.

TIMING: 2 HRs + OVERNIGHT

MATERIALS:

- Plasmid(s)
  - Plasmid with gene destined for overexpression (e.g. Src WT kinase domain)
  - Plasmid with phosphatase (e.g. YopH)
- Cells
  - Competetent Rosetta2 DE3 pLysS cells from -80ºC
- SOC media
- Plates
  - With appropriate antibiotic for both vectors.
- EVO script
  - `ric20_42_heat`

PROTOCOL:

1.	Allow a tube of 100 uL of Rosetta DE3 pLysS (shelf 2 of -80ºC) competent cells to thaw for **5 minutes at RT**. Run EVO script currently called `ric20_42_heat` to preheat ric20. 
2.	Add 1 uL of each plasmid directly to the cells (30 ng/uL of p235 #4 plasmid of my diluted aliquot and 30 ng/uL of my diluted YopH aliquot. Now both in ‘Lucelenie’s minipreps box’. ) Double check concentration in Denovix.
3.	Place the tube on **ice for 5 min**.
4.	Heat the tubes for exactly **30 s in 42ºC** using a ric20 on the EVO. 
5.	Place in ice for 2 min.
6.	Add 80 uL of preheated SOC medium to tubes and incubated them at **37ºC for 1 hour** while shaking.
7.	Leave Kan-Spec plates at 37ºC since the beginning of the protocol and 50 uL of cells were spread on plates.
8.	Incubate plates **overnight at 37ºC** (there is a plate incubator near Rosen lab: Rm 1717).


NOTES:

-	If colonies do not appear: check that you used the right antibiotics, check temperatures of incubators, or try adjusting amount of DNA.
