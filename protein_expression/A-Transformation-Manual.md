MANUAL PROTOCOL A

A. **Transformation**			

Adapted from:
https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/230240.pdf

SUMMARY:

With this transformation protocol introduce your plasmid of choice into your competent cells of choice.

TIMING: 2 HRs + OVERNIGHT

MATERIALS:

- Plasmid(s)
  - Plasmid with gene destined for overexpression (e.g. Src WT kinase domain)
  - Plasmid with phosphatase (e.g. YopH)
- Cells
  - Competent cells of your choice (from -80ºC) (e.g. Rosetta2 (DE3) pLysS)
- SOC media

PROTOCOL:

1.	Remove one tube of competent cells and place on ice. Once thawed add 2.0 µL of a 1:10 dilution of beta-mercaptoethanol to the cells. Swirl contents. **Incubate on ice for 10 minutes**, swirling gently every 2 minutes.
2.	Add 1-50 ng of expression plasmid DNA (e.g. 0.5 µL of 70 ng/uL Src plasmid to add 35 ng) and ~10 ng (e.g. 0.25 µL of 70 ng/µL YopH plasmid to add 17.5 ng) of each plasmid for co-transformation to each tube and swirl gently. **Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.**
3.	While the transformation reaction is incubating, preheat SOC media in 42ºC water bath.
4.	Heat-pulse each transformation reaction in 42ºC water bath for **20 seconds**.
5.	Incubate the transformation reaction **on ice for 2 minutes**.
6.	Add 0.9 mL of preheated SOC media to each transformation reaction and incubate at 37ºC for 1 hr with shaking at 225-250 rpm.
7.	Using a sterile spreader, spread  200 µL of the transformation reaction onto LB agar plates with the appropriate antibiotic (e.g. Kan for Src plasmid selection and Spec for YopH plasmid selection).
8.	Transformants should appear as colonies after **incubate at 37ºC overnight** (or at room temperature over the weekend). 


NOTES:

-	If colonies do not appear: check that you used the right antiboitics, check temperatures of incubators, or try adding more DNA.
