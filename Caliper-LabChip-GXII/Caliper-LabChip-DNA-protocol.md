### Materials:
- HT Protein Express LabChip (Perkin Elmer) - stored in 4°C fridge
- HT Protein Express Reagent Kit (Perkin Elmer)  - stored in 4°C fridge
- 5 µl, 100 mM TCEP  - stored in 20°C fridge
- Caliper cloth wipe - wetlab drawer or Caliper box
- 2 ml 70% isopropanol -  stored in solvent cabinet
- Protein samples (2 µL each)
- Sample plate: 4ti-0960, 96 well PCR plate (purple) 

## Chip preparation

1. Take out TCEP aliquote from -20°C for thawing or prepare a new 100 mM TCEP solution.
2. Take out HT Protein Express LabChip and from HT Protein Express Reagent Kit from 4°C fridge and let equilibriate for 20-30 minutes.
3. Follow Protein Express Chip Preparation instructions using reverse pipetting technique to avoid bubbles:

* Numbers in wells indicate how much µL of reagent needs to be added to each well. 
* In step 7 of express chip preparation: Add at least 50 uL lower marker to well 4.
* Be careful not to bend the sipper tube below the chip.
* Label the reagents with openning date.
* Remaining Gel-dye and destaining solutions can be reused withing 3 weeks after preparation, so label them with a date.
	
4. Store HT Protein Express Reagent Kit in 4°C fridge. HT Protein Express Reagent Kit contains the reagents to run three chip preparations. Each chip preparation is enough to run a 96-well plate. 


## Sample, ladder and buffer preparation

* Prepare sample and ladder solution directly on 4ti-0960 plate. 
* For heat denaturation use Ric1 on EVO deck which has adapter for PCR plate. Run EVO script: **ric20_2_heat** which heats the plates to 95°C for 1 hour. 
* In step 2: 2 uL column fractionation samples can be directly mixed with 7 uL denaturing solution.  Lysate, supernatant and flow-through samples should be diluted (20-50 fold) before mixing with denaturing solution.

## Inserting chip and samples to instrument

* Step 3: After pressing **CHIP** botton, the cartridge (black rectangle) should eject itself half-way out. If it doesn't eject, wait until the movement is finished and pull gently to eject the cartridge fully. 
* Step 4: 
	* Press the cartridge latch (in the front of cartridge) up until the upper flap is released and you can open the cartridge.
	* Insert the chip making sure sipper goes through the hole in the cartridge and press the chip into place completely before closing the cover. 
	* Press down to lock the latch in place.
	* Push the cartridge into the instrument.

## Running the electrophoresis
Connect to Caliper PC with TeamViewer via Momentum PC.  
	IP: 10.0.1.15  
	Username: Perkin Elmer  
	Password: password  

![run](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8997658/24775894/b26d1e7c-1aec-11e7-8e14-68bd74112dd0.png)

* It takes 15 minutes to prime the gel and 15 minutes to run 15 samples.
* For Src, assay type HP Protein Express 100 is appropriate.
* After the run if nothing shows up in gel view, right click on Ladder line and select "adjust exposure to this line" option.

## Clean-up and storage

Upto 96 samples can be run once the chip is primed upto 8 hours of after priming. The chip can be left inside the instrument upto 8 hours.

After 8 hours, you should take out the chip. If you haven't run 96 samples and there is still reagent on the chip you can save it for reusing the next day. Just cover wells with parafilm and put back to chip box and 4°C fridge. Also parafilm and store the ladder and buffer tubes at 4°C. When you put the chip back to instrument the next day, it will automatically be reprimed if there is enough reagent in the wells. [This procedure of repriming with the same reagent solutions withing 24 hours is not recommended by manufacturer, but we observed that it works.]

We shouldn't store the chip with reagents more than 8 hours at RT and more than 24 hours at 4C. After use, the chip must be cleaned and stored in the chip container.

1. Remove the reagents from each well of the chip using vacuum or manual pipettors.
2. Each active well (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10) should be rinsed and aspirated twice with molecular biology gradewater.
3. Add 120 μL molecular biology grade water to the active wells (all wells except 5 and 6).
4. Place the chip in the plastic storage container. The sipper should be submerged in the fluid reservoir.
5. Cover the wells with Parafilm® to prevent buffer evaporation and store in 4°C fridge.
