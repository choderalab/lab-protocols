# SAFETY PROTOCOL FOR AUTOMATION LIQUID WASTE

### LIQUID WASTE CARBOYS IN WETLAB

1. EVO liquid waste carboy
2. Density Meter liquid waste carboy

### PROTOCOL

#### Which chemicals are hazardous?
Check [OSHA Hazardous Chemical Determination page](https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghd053107.html#process) and SDS of the chemical.
It should be labeled as hazardous waste if it is a physical or health hazard:
- *Physical hazards* :  combustible liquid, a compressed gas, explosive, flammable, an organic peroxide, an oxidizer, pyrophoric, unstable (reactive) or water-reactive.
- *Health hazard* : carcinogens, toxins, irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, agents which damage the lungs, skin, eyes, mucous membranes or hematopoietic system.

#### New Waste Carboy
- Liquid waste carboy's are received from Safety department (125-2280). They are delivered clean unlabelled.
- As soon as an empty carboy is assigened as EVO/Density Meter liquid waste:
    1. Stick "hazardous waste" label
    2. Add lab name to waste label
    3. Add water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the label.
- Start a new section in [WetLab waste list](https://docs.google.com/a/choderalab.org/spreadsheets/d/13iVn3OHFi48qu1uepX6-2KrLabXh9M9DhJDAcfOGLz8/edit?usp=sharing) with the starting date of new carboy.

#### Ordinary Usage
- All chemical names should be written explicitly and without abbreviations.
- After each experiment, experimenter should record the names of the chemicals that were discarded to waste carboy:
    1. Add the names of compounds to hazardous waste label on the carboy
    2. Update [WetLab waste list](https://docs.google.com/a/choderalab.org/spreadsheets/d/13iVn3OHFi48qu1uepX6-2KrLabXh9M9DhJDAcfOGLz8/edit?usp=sharing) in Chodera Lab Google Drive. Assume 5% volume of anything dispensed with EVO fixed tips will be discarded into waste carboy with system liquid.

#### When Full
- Check that chemical labels on the carboy match the chemicals listed in [WetLab waste list](https://docs.google.com/a/choderalab.org/spreadsheets/d/13iVn3OHFi48qu1uepX6-2KrLabXh9M9DhJDAcfOGLz8/edit?usp=sharing).
- Fill out [Chemical Waste Collection Request Form](https://one.mskcc.org/sites/pub/forms/Pages/ChemicalCollection.aspx) to request waste container pickup. (Building: ZRC, Room: Z1745D, Cost Center: 54150 )
- Allow 48 hours for pick-up during workdays.
- If this fails, you can also call Safety Department at X125-2280.
- The Safety Depatment will also provide us a new container (5 gallon plastic containers (DOT approved) for liquids).
