We have three standard EVO deck layouts, they are all very similar. The only difference is what is on grid 12:
 - Layout 1 : `MP 3Pos 2015` on grid 12 
 - Layout 2 : `DiTi 3Pos` for hanging tips on grid 12  
 - Layout 3 : `Te-VacS` for vacuum filtration on grid 11

Working examples that use these layouts are saved as worktable-only templates in EVOware:

 - `Chodera_Template_1_MP3Pos`
 - `Chodera_Template_2_HangingTips`
 - `Chodera_Template_3_Vacuum`

If you select `New` to make a new script in EVOware, these templates should pop up as options.
