We have three standard EVO deck layouts, they are all very similar. The only difference is what is on grid 12:
 - Layout 1 : `MP 3Pos 2015` on grid 12 
 - Layout 2 : `DiTi 3Pos` for hanging tips on grid 12  
 - Layout 3 : `Te-VacS` for vacuum filtration on grid 11

Working examples that use these layouts are saved as templates in EVOware (`Chodera_Lab_Template_1`, etc.).
