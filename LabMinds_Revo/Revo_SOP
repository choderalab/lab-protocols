# **LabMinds Revo**

LabMinds Revo is an automated solutions preparation system. Mostly creating buffers, the maker doses and mixes precise quantities of solid and liquid reagents, and then processes them according to the profile's exact specifications/ratios. A Solution typically takes from ~45 minutes to complete. The Chodera Lab mostly order kinase binding assay buffer, phosphate buffer, and other purification buffers from it.
