Mostly creating buffers, the maker doses and mixes precise quantities of solid and liquid reagents, and then processes them according to the profile's exact specifications/ratios.

### Weekly Maintenance
As a part of Weekly Pair Tasks, lab members must **check that REVO is connected to internet.** This is done by...
1. Triple press the home button on the iPad → Unlock Guided Access by entering the iPad's passcode (`3412`)
2. NAvigate to `Settings` menu on iPad
3. Check that the wifi connection is on and working (*The Revo utilizes a special  connection that bypasses MSKCC firewalls and allows LabMinds to remotely control the instrument.*)
   * Note: The connection usually lasts longer if you use a personal MSK account wifi option rather than the guest
4. If connected, navigate back to the `Lab Minds Revo App` (sort of looks like a taxi cab yellow/black stripe; app is located in the bottom menu bar of iPad)
