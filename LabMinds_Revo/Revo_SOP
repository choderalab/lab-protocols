# **LabMinds Revo**

LabMinds Revo is an automated solutions preparation system. Mostly creating buffers, the maker doses and mixes precise quantities of solid and liquid reagents, and then processes them according to the profile's exact specifications/ratios. A Solution typically takes from ~45 minutes to complete. The Chodera Lab mostly order kinase binding assay buffer, phosphate buffer, and other purification buffers from it.

## **Quality Control/Preventative Maintenance**
### Weekly Maintenance
As a part of Weekly Pair Tasks, lab members must **check that REVO is connected to internet.** This is done by...
1. Triple press the home button on the iPad → Unlock Guided Access by entering the iPad's passcode (`3412`)
2. Naviage to the `Settings` menu on iPad.
3. Check that the wifi connection is on and working. (*The Revo utilizes a special  connection that bypasses MSKCC firewalls and allows LabMinds to remotely control the instrument.*)
   * Note: The connection usually lasts longer if you use a personal MSK account wifi option rather than the guest
4. If connected, navigate back to the `Lab Minds Revo App` (sort of looks like a taxi cab yellow/black stripe)
