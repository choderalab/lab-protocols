# Recieving Deliveries  

Task 1-4 must be performed by the user of the item. For chemicals, if you can't complete tasks 5-7 yourselves, you should send information of the delivery to Rafal. He will take care of safety documentation.
   
1. Record all types of delivery in [Deliveries and Receiving Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/choderalab.org/spreadsheets/d/1l5V3DIKl1W5obg5LXIjrCHUnrrIx-cnuJc7wu7evRTY/edit?usp=sharing). Input your initials, date, time, item description, whether document was scanned. Hopefully an entry for the expected order will already be on the end of the list labeled as "expecting" when you log on. You can just modify that entry. Also record roughly where you put it according to the wetlab and drylab map available in the second tab on that spreadsheet.

2. If it is not a chemical but a wetlab consumable, record it in [Master Consumables Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CiP7uYrjyv9ltk02AqKvY3_4E6dxD82QuPtC2JIxBGI/edit#gid=0). Check Please record the amount received and the storing location, again using the wetlab/drylab position labels. 

3. For chemical compounds, depending on storage instuctions pick the storage area and record the item it in [Dessicator Inventory](https://docs.google.com/a/choderalab.org/spreadsheets/d/1TAhKhrfAdcbwQxWJdWEWP7ud2vQjalPZKtHsQDj2Vkc/edit?usp=sharing), [PlateStable Inventory](https://docs.google.com/a/choderalab.org/spreadsheets/d/1G5QUp8qXdvego0RQgK76sPDZQAlD6N8Jy37FBhYllTk/edit?usp=sharing) or [Freezer Inventory](https://docs.google.com/a/choderalab.org/spreadsheets/d/1F-x4JrbIAd96WqROiASZuANYdQVlM8HLVpmyp_6wbBY/edit?usp=sharing).

Also make sure chemicals are up to date on the [ChemTracker inventory](https://mskcc.bioraft.com/), monitored by MSKCC.

4. All documents related to delivery must be ScanSnap'ed. 

    ###### Scanning with the ScanSnap on the wetlab Mac:
    - Log in using username 'ScanSnap' and standard password.
    - Put pages to scan in ScanSnap (Face Down, Top on Bottom).
    - Press blue button on ScanSnap to scan all pages.
    - Select 'Searchable PDF Converter'.
    - That's it! File will automatically be saved to Google Drive at choderalab/upkeep/ScanSnap/Deliveries.
    - Please file the physical paper in the drawer underneath the ScanSnap in the front (towards you) of the 'Deliveries' manila folder.
    - THANKS!

    ###### ScanSnap Tips:
    - While the ScanSnap is excellent at dealing with a variety of sizes of papers with content on both front and back, it is advisable to remove the most oddly shaped and/or fragile looking ones and scan them separately.  The ScanSnap comes with a 'Carrier Sheet' to help keep items flat. This is in the drawer under the ScanSnap.  

5. Please add all new chemicals to the [MSKCC chemical inventory](https://docs.google.com/a/choderalab.org/spreadsheets/d/1SOwhfuDNn6Vuom2MKBMirPzldHBIgRBnxtSEdpcPH20/edit?usp=sharing).
 
6. Make sure to download the corresponding SDS of each chemical from the supplier or using the MSKCC service. Print and add them to the yellow SDS binder in wetlab.

7. Put a digital copy of the SDS file to the google drive [SDS folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B075He2poqy1OWZlSEw5cFlhaXc?usp=sharing).
