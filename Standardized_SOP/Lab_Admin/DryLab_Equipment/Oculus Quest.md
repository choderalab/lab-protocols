# **Oculus Quest Virtual Reality System**

An All-In-One Virtual Reality system that does not require a PC. As of November 2019, the Oculus Quest was purchased to use congruently with  Nanome VR Molecular Software. Nanome VR software is capable of collaborative molecular modeling for Structural Biology and Drug Discovery as its interface uses virtual reality  technology to help researchers analyze, visualize, and design small molecules/proteins in an immersive space.  This immersive tool allows a more engaging experience due to its immersion, collaboration, and usability.
