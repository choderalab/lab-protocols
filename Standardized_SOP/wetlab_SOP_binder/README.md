# Wetlab SOP Binder

This is a collection of files that are currently printed out inside of a binder in the wetlab. These documents are useful "cheatsheet" documents used for consultation. That said, these may be out of date. 

Assembled by Sonya Hanson, a former postdoctoral research fellow with the Chodera Lab.
