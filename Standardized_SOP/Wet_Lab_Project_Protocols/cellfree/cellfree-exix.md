#EXIX cell-free expression kit trial

##Included components
* E. coli extract
* 5X reaction mix
* 0.25M Magnesium Acetate
* Complete amino acid set
* Amino acids without methionine
* Amino acids without lysine
* Dasher GFP positive control
* Nuclease-free water

Additional components (we have them?)

* RNAsin plus
* Halt protease inhibitor cocktail

## Standard protocol

### Preparation:
Thaw on ice:

#### These components are in the kit (-80C)
* 0.25M Magnesium Acetate
* 5X reaction mix
* Amino acid mix
* E. coli extract

#### These are elsewhere:
* DNA (500ng/ul) (possibly -80?)

Thaw only when necessary:
* Halt Protease inhibitor cocktail (4)
* RNasin plus (-20)

### Reaction Protocol

The components shown here should be added **in the exact order indicated**

|Component| Amount to add| Order of Addition|
|:----------:|:-----------:|:----------------|
|Water|9.75 ul| 1|
|Halt Protease inhibitor| 1ul | 2|
|RNasin Plus| 0.25ul| 3|
|0.25M Mg(Ac)2| 1ul| 4|
|5X reaction mix| 10ul| 5|
|Amino acid mix| 12ul| 6|
|E. coli S12 extract | 15ul|7|
|DNA (500ng/ul)|1ul|8|

* Incubate at 28C for 6 hours with rotation or agitation. Place in inheco, brought to temperature and prepared beforehand?

* End reaction by cooling to 4C (use evo?)

### Analysis of results

#### Caliper
  Use most recent chip, prepare ~40 min before end of reaction.
