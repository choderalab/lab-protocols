- Check the EVO system liquid and waste levels.
- Take the EVO offline on the Momentum software to run the Freedom EVOware maintenance scripts: MAINT_Wash and MAINT_Rehome. 
- Set up and load the labware (plates, troughs, DiTis) necessary to run the script. You can use the EVO deck layout of the specific script to make sure you positioned the labware in the correct carriers. 
- Set the DiTi position on EVOware.
- Validate the EVO scripts you will be running on your experiment. This is done by clicking "Open" on Freedom EVOware, looking for the scripts in the list, right clicking on them and selecting "Validate".
- Refresh EVO properties. This is done by right clicking on the EVO icon on Momentum's device info panel, clicking "Tasks" and "Refresh Properties". 
- Make sure the Infinite and EVO drivers are on. This is down by clicking the M1000 Driver and EVO Driver shortcuts on the EVO computer desktop.
- Bring all instruments online on the Momentum software.
- After this, create a new work unit and select the experiment that you will be running.
- Follow the work unit message to verify that plates are placed in the correct nest and position.
- When the experiment is done, clear the work unit.
- You can find the outputted Infinite files on the Google Drive (choderalab/wetlab/automation/protocols/infinite/results) https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B075He2poqy1bzFpb2JpU3I5ck0
