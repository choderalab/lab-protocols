## NEVER LEAVE THE ELECTRODE DRY!

- If the cap is empty refill it with Friscolyt-B solution.
- If you don't know what you're doing, please ask someone.
- There are also manuals in the drawers below (labeled 'pH meter') if there is interest in more advanced usage.

## Usage:
- Turn pH meter on.
- Remove cap.
- Rinse electrode with water.
- Put electrode in first calibration solution (50 mL conical tubes in yellow rack).
- Press CAL. 'Cal 1' will appear on the screen. Wait for the number to stabilize.  It will blink until it stabilizes and then beep when it's done. If this takes a while you can press READ.
