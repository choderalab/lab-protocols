# **LabMinds Revo**

LabMinds Revo is an automated solutions preparation system. The Revo is an automated buffer maker that doses and mixes precise quantities of solid and liquid reagents, processes them according to the user’s exact specifications/ratios. A Solution typically take from 45 minutes-several hours to complete. The Chodera Lab mostly order kinase binding assay buffer, phosphate buffer, and other purification buffers from it.
