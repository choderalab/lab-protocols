Scanning with the ScanSnap on the wetlab Mac:
- Log in using username 'ScanSnap' and standard password.
- Put pages to scan in ScanSnap (Face Down, Top on Bottom).
- Press blue button on ScanSnap to scan all pages.
- Select 'Searchable PDF Converter'.
- That's it! File will automatically be saved to Google Drive at choderalab/upkeep/ScanSnap/Deliveries.
- Please file the physical paper in the drawer underneath the ScanSnap in the front (towards you) of the 'Deliveries' manila folder.
- THANKS!

Record Deliveries (even if nothing to scan):
- Input your initials, date, time, item description, whether document was scanned into [this google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10cDKJJN-X4f7M6H1ys8MxaPl5cwindBdL6i9BVsTtoo/edit#gid=0). Hopefully this will already be on the screen when you log on.
- Also record roughly where you put it according to the lab map available in the second tab on that spreadsheet.
- For chemical compounds, please add them to the [chemical inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah04WWF4usIOdHNudk02Z0ZRX3EtMlpBb29QcnJYclE&usp=sharing)
  - Also, make sure to download the corresponding SDS from the supplier or using the MSKCC service. Print and add them to the SDS binder and put them in the google drive [SDS folder](https://drive.google.com/a/choderalab.org/folderview?id=0B2aRcG3eE40xM0FWREROaVR1MVE&usp=sharing).

TIPS:
- While the ScanSnap is excellent at dealing with a variety of sizes of papers with content on both front and back, it is advisable to remove the most oddly shaped and/or fragile looking ones and scan them separately.  The ScanSnap comes with a 'Carrier Sheet' to help keep items flat. This is in the drawer under the ScanSnap.
