# 4titude PlateStable Usage Protocol
Describes best practices for using PlateStables.

4titude PlateStable Newmarket enclosures are purged with dry nitrogen [grade 4.8 nitrogen (99.998% pure, < 5 ppm oxygen and moisture), from TechAir].  Enclosures are monitored weekly for oxygen content and repurged as necessary.

The PlateStable enclosures can be stored either at room temperature, 4C, or -20C. 

### -20C PlateStable 
- To avoid condensation on cold surfaces and trapping humidity inside PlatStable, before opening -20C PlateStable should be allowed to warm to room temperature. This requires making it wait on the bench for **20 minutes**. 
- Wipe the water droplets from outer surface and then open the PlateStable. 
- After item transfer, PlateStable must be purged at room temperature as soon as possible (<20 min) and put back to -20C freezer.
- Update the inventory for the item removed/added/consumed.
